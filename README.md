# Instructions
Answer the problems located inside `prob01` and `prob02`. If you have questions let your instructor or the lab assistant know. You can also consult your classmates, but please do not copy/paste code.

## Submission
*You can also find these instructions in the lab exercise guide.*

1. When everything runs correctly, let's copy your code into the Github repository. You can also do this as often as you want in order to back up and save your work. The first step is to add your code to what is called the staging area using git's `add` command. The parameter after `add` is the name of the file you want to add. There are cases when you have multiple changed files, so you can just type . (period) to add all modified files.

    ```
    git add main.cc
    ```
1. Once everything is in the staging area, we use the `commit` command to tell git that we have added everything we need into the staging area.

    ```
    git commit
    ```
    Alternatively, you could add a comment to the `commit` command in order to skip the *nano* editor step described below.

    ```
    git commit -m "Finished prob01"
    ```
1. In case it asks you  to configure global variables for an email and name, just copy the commands it provides then replace the dummy text with your email and Github username.

    ```
    git config --global user.email "tuffy@csu.fullerton.edu"
    git config --global user.name "Tuffy Titan"
    ```
    When you're done, make sure you type `git commit` again.    
1. Git will ask you to describe what you have added to the staging area. By default, you will use a command-line based editor called *nano*. Go ahead and provide a description then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd> to exit. Press <kbd>Y</kbd> to confirm that you want to make changes and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
1. Lets push all changes to the Github repository using git's `push` command. Provide your Github username and password when you are asked.

    ```
    git push
    ```
1. When you finish the exercise, go back to Canvas and find the corresponding assignment. Submit a link to your GitHub repository to complete the assignment.
